				</header>
		<p>Azor Ahai was a legendary hero who wielded a burning sword called Lightbringer, 
		according to tales from Asshai and followers of R'hllor. In some other cultures this 
		warrior is called Hyrkoon the Hero, Yin Tar, Neferion, and Eldric Shadowchaser.</p>
		
		<p>Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. 
		To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty
		days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, 
		the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.</p>
		
		<p>The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better 
		than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its
		heart, but once more the steel shattered.</p>
		
		<p>The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish 
		the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he 
		called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into
		her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer, the
		Red Sword of Heroes.</p>
		
		<p>Although he had Lightbringer, Azor Ahai did not fight alone.The Jade Compendium mentions 
		that when the hero thrust the blade through a monster, the creature burst into flame.
		It is unknown if Azor Ahai is connected with the legend of the last hero, who lived during 
		the Long Night and helped to defeat the Others</p>
