				</header>
				<p>"Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built: the 
				tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five, can you 
				imagine? Look at it now... a blasted ruin."  <br> â€•Tywin Lannister to Arya Stark</p>
				
				<p>Harrenhal is a huge castle, the largest one in all of Westeros, though it is also the most ill-omened.
				It is located on the northern shore of the Gods Eye lake at the heart of the Riverlands, south of the River
				Trident and northwest of King's Landing.</p>
				
				<p>King Harren Hoare's grandfather led the ironborn to conquer the Riverlands, previously occupied by
				the Stormlands. The ironborn cared nothing for the inhabitants of the mainland, and their rule was brutal 
				and tyrannical - far more than any previous occupier. To consolidate their hold on the Riverlands, Harren's 
				grandfather commissioned construction of a great fortress on the northern shore of the Gods Eye lake, in the
				very heart of the region. The largest and greatest fortress ever built in Westeros, it took three generations
				to finish. The ironborn broke the backs of the Riverlanders in forced labor to complete an instrument for their
				own domination. The great castle was finally finished in King Harren's time, and he arrogantly named it "Harrenhal"
				after himself. On the very same day that the last brick was laid, however, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters landed 
				with their army from Dragonstone at the mouth of the Blackwater River, along with their three dragons, beginning
				the War of Conquest</p>
				
				<p>Harren thought the walls of his massive castle could withstand any assault, but he did not realize that dragons 
				could simply fly over them. In the Burning of Harrenhal, Aegon used his dragon Balerion to roast King Harren and all
				of his sons alive within their own tower. Harrenhal was blasted with dragonfire and left half-ruined.</p>
				
				<p>Afterwards, Aegon Targaryen granted Harrenhal to his bannermen of House Qoherys, which eventually became extinct. 
				They were followed by Houses Towers, Harroway, Strong, and Lothston. All of them, like the Hoares and Qoherys before
				them, died out, leading to the castle of be considered a cursed place. Several tales are told of Harrenhal, including
				the tale of Mad Lady Lothston, the flaming ghosts of Harren and his sons, and of servants who go to sleep and are found
				turned to ashes the following day.</p>
				
				<p>Harrenhal is seen as something of a white elephant: while it is technically the biggest castle in Westeros, 
				it is so ridiculously large that the surrounding area cannot possibly produce the necessary food to support the massive
				army needed to fully man it. Rulers of Harrenhal usually lose money and resources simply by possessing it. As a result,
				Harrenhal is rarely if ever fully manned. Moreover, it was never fully repaired after being blasted with dragonfire by 
				the Targaryens three hundred years ago, which combined with the fact that the garrison is never as large as the fortifications
				require, means that Harrenhal really isn't one of the most defensibly formidable castles in Westeros.</p>
				
				<p>The surrounding lands subject to Harrenhal are actually some of the richest and most fertile in all of Westeros, being 
				located in the watersheds of both the Trident River and Gods Eye lake. In peacetime, a noble House can actually become quite 
				wealthy from holding Harrenhal - provided that they hire only a skeleton force to defend it instead of a full garrison. 
				It is a testament to the sheer size of the castle that even the most productive farmlands in Westeros cannot support enough 
				troops to fully garrison it. Nonetheless, the unwary often see Harrenhal as a great reward or prize in war, without pausing 
				to consider that there is actually little net profit in holding it.</p>
				
				<p>By the time of the War of the Five Kings, Harrenhal was held by House Whent, until they were stripped of it and the castle 
				was given to House Slynt as a reward for Janos Slynt's betrayal of Eddard Stark. However, due to the area being a warzone, Slynt
				never actually occupied the castle and was stripped of it when Janos Slynt was sent to the Wall . In Season 2, it is used as the
				main forward base for Tywin Lannister's army in the Riverlands during his campaign against Robb Stark. However, the Lannisters 
				later withdraw their forces to defend King's Landing in the decisive Battle of the Blackwater. At the beginning of Season 3 the 
				abandoned castle is re-captured by the Northern army (Robb Stark's maternal grandmother was a Whent, so he has some direct claim 
				to the castle), and Robb left a detachment of the Northern army under Roose Bolton to hold the castle. After Bolton left to attend 
				the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, the castle is manned by his crony Locke. However in Season 4, Locke is seen at Bolton's 
				side back in the North. At this time, Petyr Baelish is Lord of Harrenhal, but it is unclear who holds the castle in real terms.</p>
