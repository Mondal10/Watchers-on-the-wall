				</header>
				
				<p>House Reyne of Castamere was a noble house from Castamere in the westerlands. 
				They blazoned their arms with a red lion rampant regardant with a forked tail, armed 
				and langued gold, on silver.</p>
				
				<p>House Reyne was a family of First Men who made their subterranean seat at Castamere. 
				The mine's silver and gold made them wealthy, much like the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. 
				The Reynes joined the Kingdom of the Rock when King Loreon I Lannister wed a Reyne daughter.</p>
				
				<p>During the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, the Reynes sided with the greens. 
				Lord Reyne was killed during the Battle by the Lakeshore in 130 AC.</p>
				
				<p>During the First Blackfyre Rebellion, Ser Robb Reyne sided with Daemon I Blackfyre.
				Robb was considered one of the finest knights of his age.</p>
				
				<p>The downfall of the house had its origins in the time of Lord Robert Reyne. 
				He arranged the betrothal of his daughter Ellyn to Tywald Lannister, the son and 
				heir of Lord Gerold Lannister. Tywald served Robert as a squire during the Peake Uprising,
				but Robert and Tywald were killed in battle at Starpike in 233 AC. Lady Ellyn, who had long 
				anticipated becoming the Lady of Casterly Rock, was unwilling to forsake that dream. She persuaded
				Tywald's twin, Tion, to set aside his own fianc√© and espouse her instead. During this time, Lady Ellyn 
				held a splendid court at the Rock, staging magnificent tourneys and balls and filling the Rock with musicians,
				mummers and Reynes. She bestowed honors, offices and lands on her brothers, Roger and Reynard, and other relatives.
				An acerbic hunchback, Lord Toad, was heard saying, "Lady Ellyn must be a sorceress, for she has made it rain inside
				the Rock all year</p>
				
				<p>The death of Ser Tion Lannister in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion roused his father Gerold, who took firm control
				over the westerlands. The "Reign of the Reynes" was over. In 239 AC Ellyn was accused of trying to bed the third son
				of Lord Gerold, Tytos Lannister, which resulted in her removal from Casterly Rock and marriage to Lord Walderan Tarbeck.</p>
				
				<p>Roger Reyne, who succeeded Robert, was the Lord of Castamere during the rule of Gerold's successor, Lord Tytos Lannister.
				The Reynes had prospered greatly under Tytos's misrule. Both Roger and Ser Reynard extracted large amounts of gold from Tytos.
				After the War of the Ninepenny Kings, Tytos's son and heir, Ser Tywin Lannister, demanded repayment of the gold that was lent out,
				but Roger reportedly laughed and told his vassals to do nothing. This eventually led Tywin to summon the Reynes and the Tarbecks to 
				answer for their crimes. They chose defiance instead and with it, started the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion against their Lannister overlords.</p>
				
				<p>Tarbeck Hall was the first to feel Tywin's wrath and House Tarbeck was exterminated, including Ellyn. After an unsuccessful 
				battle against the Lannister host led by Tywin, Ser Reynard and the wounded Lord Roger took refuge in the mines underneath Castamere.
				Reynard, once his folk were safe, offered terms to Tywin. Instead Tywin ordered the sealing of Castamere's entrances and the diverting
				of nearby water into the mine, causing the deaths of all within.</p>
				
				<p>The downfall of the Reynes is popularized in "The Rains of Castamere", a song which Tywin Lannister sometimes uses for intimidation.</p>
