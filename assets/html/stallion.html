				<p>"A prince is riding. I've heard the thunder of his hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. 
				His enemies will cower before him... and their wives will weep tears of blood... the Stallion Who Mounts the World." 
				<br>- Jorah Mormont to Daenerys</p>
				
				<p>The Stallion Who Mounts the World is a prophecy in the Dothraki religion. According to the prophecy, the Stallion 
				is the "khal of khals who will unite all the Dothraki under his single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth.
				The prophecy states that "he will be the khal of khals, and all the people of the world will be his herd."</p>
				
				<p>Daenerys Targaryen's unborn son, Rhaego, was announced by the dosh khaleen to be the prophesied figure. 
				However, her son was killed in the womb before any part of the prophecy could be fulfilled. The Lhazareen 
				maegi Mirri Maz Duur believed that Rhaego would bring about unbridled death and suffering (much as Rhaego's father 
				had visited upon her village), so she tricked Daenerys into sacrificing his life for the life of her husband, Khal Drogo.</p>
				
				<p>Hence, it is now hyped that Drogon, is the Prince who was promised, who is son to her mother, the Queen to be the Stallion 
				Who Mounts The World since its been prophecized that the stallion is born within ashes.</p>
