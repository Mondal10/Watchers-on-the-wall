					<h2 class="title" align="center">LITTLE PETYR</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Petyr's great-grandfather was a Braavosi sellsword in the service 
				of Lord Corbray; when his son became a hedge knight, he took the stone
				head of the Titan of Braavos as his sigil. Petyr's father, in turn, was
				the smallest of small lords of a few rocky acres on the smallest of the 
				Fingers, who befriended Hoster Tully during his service in the War of the 
				Ninepenny Kings. This friendship led to Petyr being sent to be fostered 
				at Riverrun.</p>
				
				<p>At Riverrun, Petyr was fostered as a ward and raised alongside 
				Lord Hoster Tully's children, Catelyn, Lysa and Edmure. Because of his 
				family holdings, and because of his short stature, Edmure gave him the 
				nickname "Littlefinger", by which he is still called during the present times.
				Petyr grew close to the Tully children, and used to play with Edmure as well 
				as Catelyn and Lysa; Catelyn recalls how she and Lysa once made mud pies, which
				Petyr ate, resulting in him being sick for a week. When he had a problem, Petyr 
				went to Lord Hoster's brother, Ser Brynden Tully, just as Lord Hoster's children
				were wont to do. Petyr accompanied Lord Hoster on at least one journey that he made,
				to Seagard. As the children grew older, Petyr fell in love with Catelyn, who was several
				years his elder. She did not reciprocate those feelings, loving him as a brother instead.
				Catelyn's younger sister, Lysa, on the other hand, fell in love with Petyr. Petyr would
				play at kissing with both Catelyn and Lysa in the godswood of Riverrun, attempting to stick
				his tongue into their mouths - which Catelyn halted, but Lysa both allowed and enjoyed.</p>
				
				<p>When Catelyn's betrothal to Brandon Stark, the heir to Winterfell, was announced, 
				Lord Bracken and Blackwood were at Riverrun, to settle a fued with Lord Hoster Tully's help.
				Catelyn and Petyr danced six dances that night, but when he tried to kiss her, she pushed him
				away and laughed at him. Wounded by the rejection, Petyr got drunk, passed out at the table, 
				and was brought to his bed by Ser Brynden Tully. Lysa snuck in after him, and gave Petyr her 
				virginity that night. Still drunk, Petyr believed he was having sex with Catelyn, and even 
				called out "Cat".</p>
				
				<p>In 282 AC, when the date of Catelyn's wedding was announced, Petyr, scarcely fifteen years old, 
				challenged the twenty-year old Brandon Stark to a duel for her hand. He arrived with only a helm,
				breastplate and mail, leading to Brandon taking off most of his own armor. Petyr asked Catelyn for 
				her favor to wear, but she refused, giving it to Brandon instead. Catelyn begged Brandon not to kill
				Petyr, to which he agreed. While Brandon offered Petyr multiple chances to yield, Petyr refused to give up.
				In the end, Petyr was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds, when Brandon ended the battle with
				a backhand cut so brutal Catelyn Tully was convinced it was mortal.</p>
				
				<p>Petyr was given a fortnight to recover at Riverrun, during which time Lysa helped care for him. 
				Catelyn did not go to see him, and Petyr refused to see Edmure, who had served as Brandon's squire 
				during the duel. During this fortnight, Petyr slept with Lysa again. He would later claim to have taken 
				the maidenhood of both Tully sisters, due to his believe that his first encounter with Lysa had actually
				been with Catelyn.</p>
				
				<p>When the fortnight had passed and Petyr was strong enough, Lord Hoster sent Petyr away from Riverrun. 
				Catelyn did not say goodbye to him. However, Lysa had become pregnant with Petyr's child as a result of 
				their second sexual encounter. After Petyr had been send away, Lysa revealed her pregnancy to her father,
				hoping he would relent and allow Lysa and Petyr to marry. Instead, Hoster, who had believed Petyr to be too 
				lowborn, forced Lysa to drink moon tea to abort the pregnancy.</p>
