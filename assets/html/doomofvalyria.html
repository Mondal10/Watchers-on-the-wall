					<h2 class="title" align="center">THE DOOM OF VALYRIA</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>The Doom of Valyria, often called the Doom, was a cataclysm of an 
				unspecified nature which caused the collapse of the Valyrian Freehold,
				which had been prospering for five thousand years. It occurred approximately
				a century before Aegon's Conquest of Westeros, in 114 BC. Spells, knowledge,
				and recorded history were lost in the Doom, and the Century of Blood followed the disaster.</p>
				
				<p>Twelve years before the Doom, Lord Aenar Targaryen's maiden daughter, Daenys the Dreamer, 
				had a powerful prophetic dream along with visions that Valyria would be destroyed. Foreseeing 
				the Doom, she convinced her father to leave Valyria before the cataclysm. Aenar set sail, moving
				House Targaryen and their five dragons to the island Dragonstone. Other Houses of the narrow sea
				of Valyrian descent include the Velaryons of Driftmark and and the Celtigars of Claw Isle.</p>
				
				<p>On the day of the Doom, every hill for five hundred miles exploded, filling the air with ash 
				and smoke and fire, which killed even dragons. Earthquakes destroyed palaces, temples, and towns,
				while lakes boiled or turned to acid. The Fourteen Flames, the fiery mountains of Valyria, sent 
				molten rock a thousand feet into the air, and red clouds rained down dragonglass. The cataclysm 
				fragmented the Valyrian peninsula surrounding Valyria into numerous smaller islands and creating 
				the Smoking Sea between them. East of Valyria, Velos and Ghozai on the Isle of Cedars were destroyed by a tsunami.</p>
				
				<p>It is commonly believed that the Doom was a natural calamity caused by the eruption of the 
				Fourteen Flames, although some septons believe the polytheistic Valyrians delved too deep to the
				seven hells. Alternatively, Septon Barth and some maesters believe that Valyrian spells which 
				controlled the Fourteen Flames faltered. Other explanation include the curse of Garin the Great, 
				the fire of R'hllor, or infighting dragonlords assassinating fire mages.</p>
				
				<p>Much of Essos fell into chaos after the Doom. During the Century of Blood, the Volantenes
				unsuccessfully considered themselves the heirs to Valyria, often waging war against other Free Cities. 
				The Dothraki conquered many of the lands surrounding the Dothraki sea, and the last Ibbenese king was 
				thrown down. The Slaver Cities of Slaver's Bay regained their independence.</p>
				
				<p>Some dragonlords in Lys and Tyrosh survived the Doom, but they were soon killed along with their dragons.
				The dragonlord Aurion declared himself Emperor of Valyria and led a host from Qohor toward Valyria, but he
				and his followers were not seen again. Tommen II Lannister, King of the Rock, vanished while sailing to Valyria 
				with his blade, Brightroar, and Gerion Lannister later disappeared while searching for Brightroar. It is thus said
				that no one has returned from a journey to the ruins of Valyria, and even the most hardened sailors shudder at the
				thought of sailing to ruined Valyria.</p>
				
				<p>Many of Valyria's secrets, such as magic, the method for creating Valyrian steel, and ancient records were lost in 
				the Doom. The disaster is represented in art across the known world. Songs are sung of the Doom.</p>
